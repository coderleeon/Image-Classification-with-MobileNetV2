# Image-Classification-with-MobileNetV2
The project is an image classification module that uses a pre-trained deep learning model (MobileNetV2) to classify images into different categories. The module takes an input image, preprocesses it, makes a prediction using the pre-trained model, and then decodes the predictions to map them back to class label
